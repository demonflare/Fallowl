# Sensitive Data Protection - Security Improvements

This document summarizes the security improvements made to protect sensitive data in the application.

## Overview
A comprehensive security audit was conducted to identify and remediate potential sensitive data exposure issues across API endpoints, database queries, and logging mechanisms.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Data Sanitization Utility (server/dataSanitization.ts)
Created a centralized data sanitization module with the following functions:

- **sanitizeUser/sanitizeUsers**: Removes sensitive fields (password, auth0Id) from user objects before API responses
- **maskPhoneNumber**: Masks phone numbers showing only the last 4 digits (e.g., `********1234`)
- **maskEmail**: Masks email addresses for privacy (e.g., `ab*****@domain.com`)
- **redactSensitiveData**: Generic function to redact sensitive keys from any object

### 2. API Endpoint Sanitization
Fixed the following endpoints to properly sanitize responses:

#### User Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/users` - Now returns sanitized user list without passwords or auth0Id
- `POST /api/users` - Returns sanitized user object after creation
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Returns sanitized user object after update
- `GET /api/users/search` - Returns sanitized user list in search results
- `POST /api/users/bulk-update` - Returns sanitized user list after bulk operations

#### Profile Endpoint
- `GET /api/profile` - Removed auth0Id from response (sensitive PII)

### 3. Logging Security Improvements
Removed or minimized sensitive information from console logs:

#### Files Modified:
- **server/twilioService.ts**
  - Removed JWT token details logging (header, payload, grants)
  - Removed Account SID from token generation logs
  - Removed partial auth token from logs

- **server/userTwilioService.ts**
  - Removed TwiML App SID from access token generation logs
  
- **server/services/twilioConfigService.ts**
  - Removed API Key SID from creation logs

- **server/routes.ts**
  - Removed user email from Auth0 user creation/backfill logs
  - Removed auth0Id from user creation logs
  - Removed email from Twilio configuration logs
  - Removed username from access token generation logs

### 4. Data Already Protected
The following security measures were already in place:

- **Encryption**: Twilio credentials (auth tokens, API keys) encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **Password Hashing**: All passwords hashed using bcryptjs before storage
- **Token Expiration**: JWT access tokens have 1-hour TTL
- **Webhook Validation**: HMAC signature validation for Twilio webhooks
- **Phone Number Normalization**: Consistent E.164 format validation

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### API Response Guidelines
1. Never return password fields (hashed or otherwise)
2. Never return auth0Id or internal authentication identifiers
3. Mask phone numbers when displaying to users other than the owner
4. Use sanitization utilities consistently across all user-related endpoints

### Logging Guidelines
1. Never log tokens, API keys, or credentials (even partially)
2. Never log PII like email addresses or phone numbers
3. Log only essential identifiers (user IDs, record IDs)
4. Use generic success/error messages in logs

### Data Handling Guidelines
1. Encrypt sensitive credentials before database storage
2. Decrypt only when needed for API calls
3. Never store plaintext passwords
4. Validate and normalize phone numbers consistently

## Testing Recommendations

Before deploying to production, verify:

1. All user management endpoints return sanitized data
2. No sensitive data appears in application logs
3. Profile endpoint excludes auth0Id
4. Phone number masking works correctly
5. Email masking functions properly when needed

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
2. Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
3. Add data retention policies for logs
4. Consider field-level encryption for highly sensitive contact data
5. Implement GDPR/privacy compliance features (data export, deletion)

## Compliance

These improvements help ensure compliance with:
- GDPR (data minimization, purpose limitation)
- CCPA (privacy rights, data protection)
- PCI DSS (if handling payment data)
- HIPAA (if handling health information)
