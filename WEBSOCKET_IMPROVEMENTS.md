# WebSocket & Real-time Features - Phase 3 Implementation

## Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the WebSocket and real-time features of the DialPax CRM application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed TypeScript Errors
- **File**: `server/websocketService.ts`
- **Changes**: 
  - Made `jwksClient` nullable to properly initialize in the `initialize()` method
  - Added null check in `verifyToken()` method to prevent runtime errors
- **Impact**: Eliminates TypeScript compilation errors and prevents potential runtime crashes

### 2. Environment-Aware WebSocket Configuration
- **New File**: `client/src/lib/websocketConfig.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic protocol detection (ws: for http:, wss: for https:)
  - Environment detection for Replit, production, and development
  - Configurable reconnection settings with exponential backoff
  - Heartbeat interval configuration
  - Jitter addition to prevent thundering herd problem
- **Benefits**: Works seamlessly across all environments without manual configuration

### 3. Enhanced WebSocket Hook
- **File**: `client/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
- **Improvements**:
  - **Better Error Handling**: Added `connectionError` state to track connection issues
  - **Improved Reconnection**: 
    - Increased max reconnection attempts from 5 to 10
    - Exponential backoff with jitter (1s to 30s max delay)
    - Intentional disconnect flag to prevent unnecessary reconnection attempts
  - **Integrated Heartbeat**: Moved ping/pong logic into WebSocket lifecycle for better management
  - **Enhanced Logging**: More detailed connection status and error messages
  - **Graceful Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of timers and intervals on disconnect
- **Benefits**: More reliable connections with better user feedback and automatic recovery

### 4. WebSocket Status Indicator
- **New File**: `client/src/components/layout/WebSocketStatusIndicator.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time visual status indicator (Connected/Reconnecting/Disconnected)
  - Color-coded states: Green (connected), Amber (reconnecting), Gray (disconnected)
  - Interactive tooltips with detailed status information
  - Manual reconnect button when connection fails
  - Responsive design (hides text on mobile, shows icon only)
- **Integration**: Added to `Header.tsx` component for always-visible status

## WebSocket URL Configuration

The WebSocket URL is now dynamically configured based on the environment:

```typescript
// Development (http://localhost:5000)
ws://localhost:5000/ws

// Replit Development (https://xxx.replit.dev)
wss://xxx.replit.dev/ws

// Production (https://xxx.replit.app or custom domain)
wss://xxx.replit.app/ws
```

## Reconnection Strategy

The new reconnection strategy uses exponential backoff with jitter:

1. **Initial delay**: 1 second
2. **Growth**: Doubles with each attempt (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s...)
3. **Maximum delay**: 30 seconds
4. **Maximum attempts**: 10 attempts
5. **Jitter**: Random 0-30% variation to prevent simultaneous reconnections
6. **Manual retry**: Users can manually retry after max attempts reached

## Heartbeat Mechanism

- **Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Method**: Client sends "ping", server responds with "pong"
- **Purpose**: Keeps connection alive and detects stale connections
- **Lifecycle**: Automatically starts on connection, stops on disconnect

## Supported Real-Time Events

The WebSocket system supports the following event types:

- `connected` - Connection confirmation
- `new_call` - New call received
- `call_update` - Call status update
- `new_recording` - New recording available
- `recording_update` - Recording metadata update
- `parallel_call_started` - Parallel dialer call initiated
- `parallel_call_status` - Parallel dialer status update
- `parallel_call_connected` - Call connected in parallel dialer
- `parallel_call_ended` - Parallel dialer call ended
- `conference-ready` - Conference room ready
- `import_progress` - Contact import progress update
- `import_complete` - Contact import completed
- `import_error` - Contact import error

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Connection Establishment**: Log in and verify "Live" indicator appears
2. **Automatic Reconnection**: Temporarily disable network and verify auto-reconnect
3. **Manual Reconnection**: After max attempts, click "Retry" button
4. **Real-time Updates**: 
   - Make a call and verify call log updates in real-time
   - Import contacts and verify progress updates
   - Check parallel dialer notifications
5. **Heartbeat**: Monitor console logs for ping/pong every 30 seconds

## Known Issues

- **Vite HMR WebSocket**: Separate from application WebSocket, shows error in console but doesn't affect functionality
  - This is a development-only issue with Vite's hot module replacement
  - Does not impact the application's real-time features
  - Cannot be fixed without editing protected `vite.config.ts`

## Security Considerations

- WebSocket connections require Auth0 JWT authentication
- Tokens are passed via Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header
- Server validates tokens using JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)
- Tenant isolation enforced through userId filtering
- All production connections use WSS (WebSocket Secure)

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Connection Pooling**: Each user can have multiple WebSocket clients (multiple tabs/windows)
2. **Efficient Broadcasting**: Messages sent only to user's connected clients
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Stale connections detected and removed via heartbeat
4. **Lazy Loading**: WebSocket only connects when user is authenticated
5. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of timers and event listeners

## Future Enhancements

- Connection quality metrics (latency, packet loss)
- Offline message queuing
- Reconnection progress indicator
- WebSocket connection analytics/monitoring
- Custom event subscriptions per page
